# SessionDownloader2019
Starting in 2019, Build used a differnt format/web site for storing slides and video presentations. This made the venerable version (https://github.com/FrankLaVigne/SessionDownloader) written for PDC 09 and subsequent events outdated. 

## Update: May 2020
I've updated the repo for Build 2020.

## No Frills
This code is no frills and, since it does what I need, I'm probably not going to modify it anytime soon. If you're impatient, feel free to modify, and submit a PR.
